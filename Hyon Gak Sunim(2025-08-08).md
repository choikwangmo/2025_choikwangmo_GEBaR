## 🧘 From Harvard to Nanhua Temple – Schopenhauer and Seung Sahn

Hyun Gak ([[Hyon Gak Sunim(deutsch, 2025-08-08)|Paul Muenzen]]) was born in 1964 in New Jersey, United States, into a German-Irish Catholic family. From his school years, he was deeply engaged with literature and philosophy, especially the “intellectual honesty” of Arthur Schopenhauer. At Yale University, he studied philosophy and literature, and at Harvard, he pursued a master’s degree in comparative religion, exploring the intersections of Western thought and Eastern spirituality. While working at a Wall Street law firm, he grew disillusioned with materialism. At a moment of suicidal intent on the Brooklyn Bridge, a homeless man sang to him, saying, “Today is your birthday.” Hyun Gak later recalled this as the moment he “died and was born anew,” seeing the man as a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara.

He met Zen Master Seung Sahn during a Harvard lecture and encountered Zen through the Cambridge Zen Center. After experiencing a retreat at Sinwonsa Temple in Korea, he ordained in 1992 under Seung Sahn at Nanhua Temple in China, formally entering the Jogye Order lineage — “Gyeongheo → Mangong → Seung Sahn → Hyun Gak.”

## 📖 “Pilgrimage” and the Era of Free Practice

In the late 1990s, the KBS documentary _Pilgrimage_ and his book _Pilgrimage: From Harvard to Hwagyesa_ brought him public recognition. He compiled Seung Sahn’s English Dharma talks in works such as _Compass of Zen_ and _Only Don’t Know_, gaining a wide readership. Hyun Gak embodied **Mu-ae-haeng** — free practice without discrimination of setting or audience — using media, public speaking, and writing to transmit nondual philosophy and “manifest koans” (顯性公案) in real time. Over time, he may have recognized that his public openness risked blurring the lines between his mission, identity, and ego.

## 🔄 Criticism and Transformation – The Path of Silence

In 2016, Hyun Gak announced on Facebook that he would leave Korean Buddhism, criticizing what he saw as materialism, ethnic bias, and institutional insularity. His statement that “foreign monks are just decorative pieces” revealed long-standing wounds. After the dissolution of the Hwagyesa International Zen Center, he relocated to Regensburg, Germany. Later, he explained that the controversy was due to a misunderstanding from his limited Korean ability.

He sharply criticized Haemin Sunim as a “parasite” and “seller of the Dharma,” but within a day, called him “a beautiful person” and declared reconciliation. While this reversal drew criticism, it could also be seen as an instance of Zen paradox and the practice of compassion. From then on, he withdrew into seclusion at Bul-ui Seonwon (“Nonduality Zen Center”) in Germany, greatly reducing public appearances and limiting his teachings to simple English on YouTube.

## ⚖ From Free Expression to Silence – A Contrast of Practice

Early in his path, Hyun Gak’s approach mirrored the Gyeongheo-style **Mu-ae-haeng** — breaking boundaries, dissolving distinctions, and boldly proclaiming truth in the present. Yet such a style risks sliding into **intentionality within non-doing** or the **narcissism of the intellectual practitioner**.

In his current life, marked by strict silence and physical distance from followers, Hyun Gak’s choices reflect an inward ethical reckoning:

> “Truth cannot be spoken or shown. It is touched only in silence.”  
> — from his commentary on the Diamond Sutra

Remaining a Jogye Order monk, he follows a discipline-centered life, moving beyond the expressive turbulence and ego-display of earlier years toward **Buddhism as ethics, practice as lived conduct**.

## 🌏 One Person, One World – A Practice Without Return

Hyun Gak maintains a deep love for Korea — from weeping at the national anthem in Sinwonsa Temple, to sensing a past life at the 50th Liberation Anniversary, to reconciling tensions between Seung Sahn and his parents, and conversing with Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan. He embraces all of these within a stance of “not leaving.”

Today, he teaches Korean-style _Ganhwa Seon_ at Bul-ui Seonwon in Germany, telling students, “The essence of Korean Buddhism lies in uncompromising practice and discipline.” He still holds the _hwadu_, yet carries the heavier weight of silence.

He does not speak.  
And in not speaking, he communicates even more.
